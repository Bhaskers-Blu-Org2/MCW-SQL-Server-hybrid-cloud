# SQL Server Hybrid Cloud before the hands-on lab setup guide 

## Requirements

1.  Microsoft Azure Subscription

2.  Virtual Machine Built during this hands-on lab or local machine with the following:

    - Visual Studio 2017 Community or Enterprise Edition
    - Latest Azure PowerShell cmdlets:
        - <https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/downloads/>
        - <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/install-azurerm-ps>
        - Ensure you reboot after installing the SDK or Azure PowerShell may not work correctly.

## Before the hands-on lab

Duration: 60 minutes

In this exercise, you deploy an on-premises environment and the Azure infrastructure necessary to support the disaster recovery site in Azure. The on-premises environment will be hosted in an Azure Resource Group. 

### Task 1: Deploy the on-premises environment 

1.  Browse to the Azure portal at <https://portal.azure.com>and verify that you are logged in with the subscription that you wish to use for this lab.

    >**Note**: You may need to launch an \"in-private\" session in your browser if you have multiple Microsoft Accounts.

2.  Click the **Deploy to Azure** button below.

    <img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/9285dd3998997a0835869065bb15e5d500475034/687474703a2f2f617a7572656465706c6f792e6e65742f6465706c6f79627574746f6e2e706e67" data-canonical-src="http://azuredeploy.net/deploybutton.png" style="max-width:100%;"></a>

3.  On the **Custom deployment** blade, select **Create new** under for the resource group and name the resource group ***OnPremises***. Accept the terms and conditions and click **Purchase**.
   
    ![The Azure custom deployments blade is shown. The setting for resource group has been changed to OnPremises and the I agree to the terms and conditions stated above checkbox has been checked. All other values have been left at the defaults.](images/before-the-hands-on-lab/2019-03-16-10-41-15.png "Custom deployment blade")

4. Wait for the deployment to complete. This may take up to 45 minutes.

5. Login to the Hyper-V host server, **sh360host**, using **demouser** for the login account and **demo@pass123** for the password. This will launch a run-once script to configure the virtual machines which you will protect with your DR configuration in Azure. 

    > **Note**: You may continue with the next task while this completes.

### Task 2: Deploy the Azure infrastructure to support your disaster recovery site

1.  Click the **Deploy to Azure** button below.

    <a href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fciphertxt%2Fcw-smart-hotel-360-iaas%2Fmaster%2Ftemplate%2FSmartHotelCloud.json" rel="nofollow">
    <img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/9285dd3998997a0835869065bb15e5d500475034/687474703a2f2f617a7572656465706c6f792e6e65742f6465706c6f79627574746f6e2e706e67" data-canonical-src="http://azuredeploy.net/deploybutton.png" style="max-width:100%;"></a>

2.  On the **Custom deployment** blade, select **Create new** under for the resource group and name the resource group ***DRsite***. Accept the terms and conditions and click **Purchase**.

    ![The Azure custom deployments blade is shown. The setting for resource group has been changed to DRsite and the I agree to the terms and conditions stated above checkbox has been checked. All other values have been left at the defaults.](images/before-the-hands-on-lab/2019-03-16-11-31-31.png "Custom deployment blade")

    > **Note**: If you used a different resource group name in the first deployment you will need to update it here as well.

3.  Wait for the deployment to complete. This will take up to 25 minutes.

### Task 2: Verify on-premises virtual machines domain join status 

1.  Login to your Hyper-V host server, **sh360host**.

2.  Launch the **Hyper-V Manager** application from within **sh360host**.

3.  Connect to each of the three virtual machines. Login with credentials **Administrator** with a password of **demo@pass123**

    ![The Windows Hyper-V Manager app is shown with the three virtual machines running.](images/before-the-hands-on-lab/2019-03-16-12-16-38.png "Hyper-v Manager")

4.  After a minute or so, the Server Manager application should launch on its own. 

5.  Navigate to **Local Server** on the left side menu. Verify that the domain name is **sh360.local**

    ![The Windows Server Manager app is shown with Local Server selected and the domain highlighted. The domain name is sh360.local.](images/before-the-hands-on-lab/2019-03-16-11-57-38.png "Server Manager")

6.  If the machine has not joined the domain, open a PowerShell ISE window. Copy and paste the following code into the script editor. Changing the value of **$vmToJoinIP** to reflect the IP address of this server.

    ```
    Write-Output "Configuring VMs..."
    $vmToJoinIP = "192.168.0.N"
    $localusername = "Administrator"
    $password = ConvertTo-SecureString "demo@pass123" -AsPlainText -Force
    $localcredential = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential ($localusername, $password)
    $domainusername = "SH360\demouser"
    $domaincredential = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential ($domainusername, $password)

    Write-Output "Configuring VM at $vmToJoinIP..."
    Invoke-Command -ComputerName "192.168.0.$i" -ScriptBlock { 
    Add-Computer -DomainName "sh360.local" -Credential $Using:domaincredential -Restart -Force 
    } -Credential $localcredential
    Write-Output "Configuration complete"
    ```

7.  Repeat the above steps for the remaining servers.

### Task 3: Verify the website is operational 

1.  In the Azure portal, navigate to the **OnPremises** resource group. 

2.  Open the **sh360tm** Traffic Manager resource.

    ![Screen capture of the Traffic Manager icon from the Azure portal.](images/before-the-hands-on-lab/2019-03-16-13-10-40.png "Traffic Manager")

3.  Copy the **DNS name**.

4.  Paste the DNS name into a web browser. You should see the smart hotel web page.

    ![Screen capture of the smart hotel web application showing the smart hotel logo in the upper left and a table of customer information covering the rest of the page.](images/before-the-hands-on-lab/2019-03-16-13-09-17.png "Smart Hotel")


## Summary

In this exercise, you deployed and validated your "On-Premises" environment and your Azure disaster recovery site. You also verified that all three servers have successfully joined the domain. In the lab you will reconfigure your on-premises environment for high availability.

You should follow all steps provided *before* attending the Hands-on lab.
