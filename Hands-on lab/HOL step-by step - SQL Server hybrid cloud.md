## Exercise 1: SQL Backup solution

Duration: 30 minutes

Backups must be maintained offsite from the on-premises environment. The backups must be online and accessible by the DBA team. To accomplish this you will configure SQL Managed Backup.

### Task 1: Create an Azure Storage Account

In this task, you will create an Azure Storage Account for use with SQL Managed Backup.

1.  Connect to your Hyper-V host server by navigating to your **OnPremises** resource group and then connecting to the **sh360host** virtual machine.

2.  Launch the **Hyper-V Manager** application and connect to the SQL Server guest virtual machine.

3.  Launch **Server Manager**, select **Local Server** from the menu on the left and verify that **IE Enhanced Security Configuration** is set to **Off**.

    ![Server manager applciation with local server selected and IE Enhanced Security Configuration set to Off.](images/hands-on-lab/2019-03-16-14-00-37.png "Server Manager local server configuration")

4.  From within your SQL Server guest virtual machine, install Azure PowerShell by launching an **administrative PowerShell ISE session** and running the following command. Accept any warnings or authorization to install the components.

    ```
    Install-Module -Name AzureRM -AllowClobber
    ```

5.  From the PowerShell ISE, type the following at the prompt and follow the prompts to login to your Azure subscription.

    ```
    login-AzureRmAccount
    ```

6.  Execute the following PowerShell commands in the PowerShell ISE to create a new storage account and generate the T-SQL needed to configure managed backup for the database. Before executing the script, change the **$storageAcctName** variable to a unique name.

    ```powershell
    $storageAcctName = "[unique storage account name]"

    $resourceGroupName = "DRsite"
    $containerName= "backups"
    $location = "South Central US"
    $storageSkuName = "Standard_LRS"

    "Creating Storage Account $storageAcctName"
    $sa = New-AzureRmStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName  `
        -Name $storageAcctName `
        -Location $location `
        -SkuName $storageSkuName 

    $storageKey = (Get-AzureRmStorageAccountKey -Name $storageAcctName -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName )[0].Value
    $context = New-AzureStorageContext -StorageAccountName $storageAcctName -StorageAccountKey $storageKey

    Write-Host "Creating New Storage Container  $containerName" 
    New-AzureStorageContainer -name $containerName -permission container -context $context

    $fullSasToken = New-AzureStorageContainerSASToken -Name $containerName -Permission rwdl -FullUri -Context $context  
    $containerUrl = $fullSasToken.Substring(0,$fullSasToken.IndexOf("?"))
    $sasToken = $fullSasToken.Substring($fullSasToken.IndexOf("?")+1)

    $enableManagedBackupScript = @"
    --------------------
    ---BEGIN TSQL Script
    --------------------
    CREATE CREDENTIAL [$containerUrl] 
    WITH IDENTITY = 'Shared Access Signature', 
         SECRET = '$sasToken' 

    GO

    EXEC msdb.managed_backup.sp_backup_config_basic   
     @enable_backup = 1,   
     @database_name = 'SmartHotel.Registration',  
     @container_url = '$containerUrl',   
     @retention_days = 30
       
     --------------------
     ---END TSQL Script
     --------------------
    "@

    Write-Host $enableManagedBackupScript 
    ```

7.  Execute the code using PowerShell ISE. Make sure you change the **\$storageAcctName = \"\[unique storage account name\]\"** field to a unique storage account name across Azure prior to execution. 

    >**Note**: Due to differences between markdown and PowerShell formatting requirements, you may need to remove the white space prior to the **\"\@** near the end of the file.

8.  Save the T-SQL code generated between the **Begin TSQL Script** and **End TSQL Script** in your PowerShell ISE output after execution into a notepad file. This code creates an identity using a Shared Access Signature (SAS) to a container in the storage account and configures managed backup when executed.

### Task 2: Configure managed backup in SQL Server

1.  From within your SQL Server virtual machine, launch SQL Server Management Studio and connect to the local database instance.

2.  From within SQL Server Management Studio, click **New Query**.

    ![A screen showing how to launch the new query pane in SQL Server Management Studio.](images/hands-on-lab/2019-03-20-11-08-08.png "Launching the new query pane")

3.  Refresh SQL Server Management Studio and if SQL Server Agent is stopped right click on it and click Start.

    ![SQL Server Management Studio indicating the location of where to see the current status of the SQL Server Agent](images/hands-on-lab/2019-03-16-14-19-27.png "Management Studio" )

4. Paste in the following code and click **Execute** to enable SQL Server Agent extended stored procedures. 

    ```sql
    EXEC sp_configure 'show advanced options', 1
    GO
    RECONFIGURE
    GO
    EXEC sp_configure 'Agent XPs', 1
    GO
    RECONFIGURE
    GO
    ```

4.  Paste the T-SQL code you copied at the end of the previous task into the query window replacing the existing code and click **Execute**. This code creates the new SQL identity with a Shared Access Signature for your storage account. 

5.  Paste the code below into the query window replacing the existing code and click **Execute** to create a custom backup schedule.

    ```sql
    USE msdb;  
    GO  
    EXEC managed_backup.sp_backup_config_schedule   
         @database_name =  'SmartHotel.Registration'  
        ,@scheduling_option = 'Custom'  
        ,@full_backup_freq_type = 'Weekly'  
        ,@days_of_week = 'Monday'  
        ,@backup_begin_time =  '17:30'  
        ,@backup_duration = '02:00'  
        ,@log_backup_freq = '00:05'  
    GO
    ```
6.  Execute the following tSQL in the query window to generate a backup on-demand. You can also specify Log for \@type.

    ```sql
    EXEC msdb.managed_backup.sp_backup_on_demand   
    @database_name  = 'SmartHotel.Registration',
    @type ='Database'
    ```

7. To verify that your backups are working, go to the Azure portal, navigate to your **DRsite** resource group. Open the storage account you just created, select the **Blobs** tile, then the **backups** container. You should see your backups here.

## Exercise 2: Implement a Data Archive Strategy with SQL Server Stretch Database

Duration: 30 minutes

In this exercise, you will implement SQL Server Stretch Database to stretch data from a table into Azure.

### Task 1: Crete a logical SQL Server to host Stretch DB 

1.  Connect to your Hyper-V host server by navigating to your **OnPremises** resource group and then connecting to the **sh360host** virtual machine.

2.  Launch the Chrome and navigate to the Azure portal.

3.  Click **+Create a resource** at the top of the left side menu.

4.  Type **SQL Server logical server** into the search box, hit enter and choose **SQL server (logical server)** from the search results.
    ![Azure Marketplace search for SQL Server logical server](images/hands-on-lab/2019-03-20-11-38-42.png "Search for SQL Server logical server")

5. Click **Create** on the SQL Server (logical server) information blade.
6. On the SQL Server (logical server) blade, use the following configurations and click **Create**.

    - Server name: ***Choose a unique server name***
    - Server admin login: **demouser**
    - Password: **demo@pass123**
    - Subscription: ***Your subscription***
    - Resource group: **DRsite**
    - Location: ***Use the same location you have been using***
    - Allow Azure Services: ***Checked***

        ![](images/hands-on-lab/2019-03-20-11-44-41.png)

7. Make note of the server name you chose above. It will be used in a later task.
8. After the SQL Server logical server has deployed, navigate to it and select **Firewalls and virtual networks** from the security menu on the left.

    ![Security menu with Firewalls and virtual networks highlighted.](images/hands-on-lab/2019-03-20-11-56-21.png "Security menu")

9. Add a new firewall rule by clicking **+Add client IP** and then clicking **Save**.

    ![](images/hands-on-lab/2019-03-20-12-01-55.png "Firewall configuration")

### Task 2: Identify tables that may benefit from Stretch DB 

1.  Connect to your Hyper-V host server by navigating to your **OnPremises** resource group and then connecting to the **sh360host** virtual machine.

2.  Launch the **Hyper-V Manager** application and connect to the SQL Server guest virtual machine.

3.  Launch SQL Server Management Studio.

4.  In the SQL Server Management Studio Object Explorer, connect to your local SQL Server instance and expand the Databases folder.

5.  Right-click the SmartHotel.Registration database, select Tasks, select Stretch, then choose Enable.

    ![SQL Server Management Studio Object Explorer with the Smart Hotel right-click menu open, tasks is highlighted then stretch is highlighted and Enable is selected.](images/hands-on-lab/2019-03-20-11-22-09.png "Enable Stretch Database")

6.  The Enable Database for Stretch wizard should open automatically. Click **Next** on the Introduction screen.

7.  On the Select tables window all of your tables will be listed. Notice that some tables have warnings and some may be greyed out. Click on the warning icon next to the Bookings table. This warning indicates that the table does not meet the StretchDB eligibility requirements.

    ![Stretch Database Wizard showing error for the bookings table](images/hands-on-lab/2019-03-20-11-26-55.png "Stretch Database wizard")

8.  Scroll to the right until you see the Migrate column. Clicking Entire Table on an eligable table allows you to define which rows will be migrated to Azure. In this lab we are going to configure this through TSQL. Click Cancel to break out of the wizard.

### Task 3: Implement Stretch DB on based on date key  

1.  Launch a new Query tab and execute the following code to prepare the server and the database for Stretch Database. 

    ```
    --Enable the server for Stretch Database
    EXEC sp_configure 'remote data archive' , '1';
    GO
    RECONFIGURE;
    GO

    --Create a database master key to encrypt the data stored in Azure
    USE [SmartHotel.Registration]
    GO
    CREATE MASTER KEY ENCRYPTION BY PASSWORD='demo@pass123'
    GO

    --Create the credential used to access an Azure SQL Database
    CREATE DATABASE SCOPED CREDENTIAL StretchDB 
    WITH IDENTITY = 'demouser' , SECRET = 'demo@pass123'
    GO
    ```

2.  Execute the following code replacing the server name with the name of the SQL Server you created in exercise 1. This code enables Stretch Database on your database. It may take a few minutes to complete.

    ```
    --Enable the local database for stretch
    --You must change your server name to match your environment
    ALTER DATABASE [SmartHotel.Registration]
    SET REMOTE_DATA_ARCHIVE = ON (SERVER = N'<your server name>.database.windows.net', CREDENTIAL = StretchDB )
    ```

3.  Execute the following code to create the stretch predicate. The stretch predicate allows us to define the conditions under which a row will be stretched. In this case the function leverages a date key column to stretch any rows prior to January 1, 2014. 

    ```
    --Create the stretch predicate
    CREATE FUNCTION dbo.fn_stretch_datekey_predicate(@column1 int)
    RETURNS TABLE
    WITH SCHEMABINDING 
    AS 
    RETURN	SELECT 1 AS is_eligible
		    WHERE @column1 < '20020101'
    GO
    ```

4. Execute the following to begin the migration of eligible data to your Azure SQL Database.

    ```
    --Enable stretch on the table using the stretch predicate with the OrderDateKey
    ALTER TABLE ResellerSales 
    SET ( REMOTE_DATA_ARCHIVE = ON (
	    FILTER_PREDICATE = dbo.fn_stretch_datekey_predicate([OrderDateKey]),
	    MIGRATION_STATE = OUTBOUND
    ) )

5. Refresh the SmartHotel.Registration database in Object Explorer by right clicking it and choosing Refresh.

6. Right-click the SmartHotel.Registration database, choose Tasks, Stretch, then select Monitor

7. View the stretch database report. Note that over time the Eligible Rows, Local Rows, and Rows In Azure numbers will change.

    ![](images/hands-on-lab/2019-03-20-12-21-30.png)

8.	Click the dropdown under Migration State. Notice that you have the option to pause the outbound migration.

9.	Launch a new Query tab and execute the following code to programatically monitor space used in Azure and locally.

    ```
    sp_spaceused 'ResellerSales', @mode = 'REMOTE_ONLY'
    GO
    sp_spaceused 'ResellerSales', @mode = 'LOCAL_ONLY'
    GO
    ```
10. You may also change the scope of a query.

    ```
    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM [ResellerSales] WITH (REMOTE_DATA_ARCHIVE_OVERRIDE = REMOTE_ONLY)
    ```

## Summary
In this exercise, you implemented an archive solution with Stretch Database. First, you reviewed the table compatibility by using the Enable Database for Stretch wizard. You then configured your database and table via T-SQL to archive data satisfied by a stretch predicate. Finally, you reviewed the progress, status and space used locally and in Azure via the built-in management tools

## Exercise 3: Build SQL Availability Group for Database Disaster Recovery

Duration: 60 minutes

In this exercise, you will build a hybrid-cloud SQL Always-On Cluster for resiliency of the data tier.

### Task 1: Create the cluster

1.  Launch a browser and navigate to <https://portal.azure.com>. Login 
    with your Azure credentials if you haven't already.

    > Note: You may need to launch an \"in-private\" session in your
browser if you have multiple Microsoft Accounts.

2.  Navigate to your **DRsite** resource group and open your **sh360azsql2** virtual machine and connect to it via Remote Desktop.

3.  Login with the **sh360.local\demouser** domain account with password **demo@pass123**. Note that this is NOT the same account that you have been using, this is a domain account.

4.  Launch Server Manager if it does not start automatically. 

5.  Select **Local Server** from the menu on the left and scroll down to **Roles and Features**, click the **Tasks** dropdown and select **Add Roles and Features** from the list.

    ![Server Administrator Application with local server selected, and add roles and features selected in the tasks dropdown of the Roles and Features section.](images/hands-on-lab/2019-03-20-17-33-21.png "Adding Roles and Features")

6.  On the **Before you begin** page, click **Next**.

7.  On the **Select installation type** page, select **Role-based or feature-based installation** and click **Next**.

8.  On the **Select destination server** page, select the current server and click **Next**.

9.  On the **Select server roles** page, accept the defaults and click **Next**.

10. On the **Select features** page, select **Failover Clustering**, then click **Add Features** on the popup and then click **Next**.

    ![The add roles and features wizard with Failover Clustering selected on the select features page.](images/hands-on-lab/2019-03-20-17-48-43.png "Add Failover Clustering")

11. On the **Confirm installation selections** page, click **Install**.

12. Repeat the above steps to install Failover Clustering on your on-premises SQL Server (SMARTHOTELSQL1).

3.  On sh360azsql2 Open the PowerShell ISE and execute the following code:

    ```
    New-Cluster -Name CLUST01 -Node SQLVM-01,SQLVM-02 -StaticAddress 10.0.0.7
    ```

    This will create a three node cluster with a static IP address. It is also possible to use a wizard for this task but the resulting cluster will require additional configuration to set the static IP address to be viable in Azure. This is due to the manner in which Azure DHCP distributes IP addresses causing the cluster to receive the same IP address as the node it is executing on resulting in a duplicate IP address and failure of the cluster service.

4.  Open the Failover Cluster Manager on SQVM-01 from the start menu under Winows Administrative Tools. In the right navigation right-click **Failover Cluster Manager** and click **Connect to Cluster**. Click OK in the pop-up. Expand the CLUST-01 cluster, select Nodes, validate that all nodes are online and that Assigned Vote and Current Vote are 1 for all nodes of the cluster.

    ![](Exercise2images/media/image1.png)

### Task 2: Create the SQL Server Availability Group

1.  In SQLVM-01, launch **SQL Server 2016 Configuration Manager**.

    ![](Exercise3images/media/image2.png)

2.  Click **SQL Server Services**, then right-click **SQL Server
    (MSSQLSERVER)** and select **Properties**.

    ![](Exercise3images/media/image3.png)

3.  Click on the **Log On** tab. To setup a SQL Server Availability
    Group the SQL Server service account needs to have access to all of
    the SQL Servers that will participate in the Availability Group.
    Change the service account to the **CONTOSO\\demouser** domain
    account using **demo@pass123** for the password.

    ![](Exercise3images/media/image4.png)

4.  Select the **AlwaysOn High Availability** tab and check the box for
    **Enable AlwaysOn Availability Groups**, then click **OK**, then
    click **Yes** to confirm the account change.

    ![](Exercise3images/media/image5.png)

    ![](Exercise3images/media/image6.png)

5.  Repeat steps 2-6 on **SQLVM-02**.

6.  The database you will be replicating has its data files in the
    C:\\SQLDATA folder on SQLVM-01. We need to create the same folder
    structure on our secondary server, SQLVM-02. Login to **SQLVM-02**
    and create the **C:\\SQLDATA** folder.

7.  Open a remote desktop connection to the SQLVM-01 virtual machine and
    login using the **CONTOSO\\demouser** account. Note that this
    demouser account is the domain administrator account. You must type
    the domain name in, otherwise you will be logged in with the local
    administrator account.

    ![](Exercise3images/media/image1.png)

    ![](Exercise3images/media/image7.png)

8.   Your SQL Server Availability Group will require a file share to be
    used for the initial synchronization. Open up File Explorer and
    create a new folder in the root of the C: drive called **AG**.
    ![](Exercise3images/media/image8.png)

9.   Right-click the new folder and select **Share with \> Specific
    people...**

10.  On the File Sharing window, select **Administrators** and click
    **Share**, then click **Done**.
    ![](Exercise3images/media/image9.png)

11.  Launch **Microsoft** **SQL Server Management Studio** and connect to
    the local instance of SQL Server.
    ![](Exercise3images/media/image10.png)

12.  Right-click **AlwaysOn High Availability** then select **New
    Availability Group Wizard...**
    ![](Exercise3images/media/image11.png)

13. Click **Next** on the introduction screen.

14. Specify **AdventureWorks** for the name of the availability group
    and click Next

    ![](Exercise3images/media/image12.png)

15. Select the **AdventureWorksDW2016CTP3** database. The status of the
    database should state that it \"Meets prerequisites\" meaning that
    the database is in Full recovery mode.

    ![](Exercise3images/media/image13.png)

16. On the Replicas tab, click the **Add Replica...** button and connect
    to SQLVM-02.

    ![](Exercise3images/media/image14.png)

17. Click on the **Listener** tab, select the **Create an availability
    group listener** radio button, set the following values for the
    listener, then click **Add**.

    - Listener DNS Name: **adventureworks**

    - Port: **1433**

    - Network Mode: **Static IP**

        ![](Exercise3images/media/image15.png)

### Summary

In this exercise, you deployed resilient web servers behind a load balancer, and a SQL Always-On Availability Group for database resiliency through an ARM template. Also you deployed resilient web tier with an external load balancer through an ARM template.

## Exercise 4: Configure Azure Site Recovery to Web Tier DR 

Duration: 15 minutes

In this exercise, you will configure SQL Server Managed Backup to back up to an Azure Storage Account.

### Task 1: Site Recovery Stuff
  
## Exercise 5: Validate resiliency

### Task 1: Validate resiliency for the CloudShop application 

1.  In the Azure portal, open the **CloudShopRG** resource group. Click the Load Balancer, **OPSLB**.

2.  Click the **Overview** tab and copy the public IP address to the clipboard, and navigate to it in a different browser tab.

3.  After the application is loaded, click the Spike CPU button to simulate an auto scale event.

    ![A screen that shows the web page that allows for spiking the CPU,.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-BuildingaresilientIaaSarchitectureimages/media/image105.png "CPU Spike Demo")

4.  After 15-20 minutes, refresh the browser and you will see cloud shop site is running and switched from one web server to another one. 

### Task 2: Validate SQL Always On

1.  Within the Azure portal, click on Virtual Machines and open **SQL0** Click **Stop** at the top of the blade to shut the virtual machine off.

2.  After the VM is deallocated, refresh the CloudShop application in your browser. If the page loads with data in the dropdown list SQL has successfully failed over the primary node to the secondary. You can login to the secondary vm (SQL1) and connect via SQL Server Management Studio to confirm.

### Task 3: Validate backups are taken 

1.  In the Azure portal, click All Services and search for Recovery Vault. Click the link and you should see the two recovery vaults created as part of the deployment of the Active Directory domain controllers.

2.  Open each vault and validate that a backup of the VM has occurred.

    ![The screen shows 2 backup items from one of the vaults.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-BuildingaresilientIaaSarchitectureimages/media/image109.png "Usage")

    >**Note**: Backup storage consumption may be 0 B if a backup has not occurred. The timing of backups is driven by the policy associated with the backup. Only one policy can be assigned to a virtual machine when using the Azure Backup Extension for Virtual Machines.

3.  To validate the SQL Server backup, open the Storage Account created earlier in the Azure portal and click **Blobs** -\> and then **backups**. If the backup has already completed, you will see the backup file in the container.

    ![An image that depicts SQL Server backup data in an Azure Storage Account.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-BuildingaresilientIaaSarchitectureimages/media/image110.png "Backup files in storage")

## Exercise 6: Implementing Azure Site Recovery 

### Task 1: Configure ASR Protection for Cloud Shop

1. In the Azure Portal - Resource Group - BackupVault2RG and open the BackupVault2.
   
2. In the **BackupVault2** blade, click on **Site Recovery** under **GETTING STARTED**.
   
3. Under **FOR ON-PREMISES MACHINES AND AZURE VMS** click **Step 1: Replicate Application**.

    ![An image that depicts Azure Site Recovery. An arrow points to Step 1: Replicate Application.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-BuildingaresilientIaaSarchitectureimages/media/image03.png "Replicate application Settings")

4. On Step 1 Source, under Source Location choose the azure region where your Cloud Shop deployment exists. Then under Source resource group select the resource group where your Cloud Shop deployment exists (e.g. "CloudShopRG"). Select **Resource Manager** as Azure VM Deployment Model. Click OK.

    ![An image that depicts Azure Site Recovery settings.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-BuildingaresilientIaaSarchitectureimages/media/image04.png "ASR replicate source settings")

5. On Step 2, Select the Virtual Machines (Web and SQL Servers) for the replication.

6. On the Configure settings blade, notice that you can alter the target resource group and virtual network settings, along with the replication policy. Click **Create target resources**. 

    **Note**: Do not close the blade. It will close by itself after the target resources are created (2-3 minutes).

7. Several Site Recovery jobs will be initiated which are creating the replication policy as well as the target resources to be used during a failover. 

8. If you click on the Enable replication job, you can see additional details of what takes place when protecting a VM. It may take up to 30 minutes to complete the job. You can review it under Monitoring - Site Recovery Jobs at the Recovery Services Vault BackupVault2 blade. 
   
    ![An image that depicts Azure Site Recovery settings.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-BuildingaresilientIaaSarchitectureimages/media/image05.png "ASR replicate source settings")

9. Once all the Enable replication jobs are successful, click on **Replicated items** under **Protected Items** to view the status of the initial replication.
    
10. While waiting for the initial replication/synchronization, move on to the next task.

### Task 2: Creating the Recovery Plan

In this task, you will create the recovery plan that will be used to orchestrate failover actions, such as the order in which failed-over VMs are powered on.

1. Within the properties of the Recovery Services vault, click on **Recovery Plans (Site Recovery)** under Manage. Click on Step 2: Manage Recovery Plans.

    ![An image that depicts Azure Recovery Plan for Site Recovery.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-BuildingaresilientIaaSarchitectureimages/media/image06.png "ASR Recovery Plan")

2. On the Create recovery plan blade enter the name CloudShopRP. In the Source area select the region where you deployed Cloud Shop. The Target will be automatically selected. Under Allow items with deployment model, select Resource Manager. Click Select items and select the Virtual Machines. Click OK and, back on the Create recovery plan blade, click OK.

    ![An image that depicts Azure Recovery Plan Settings.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-BuildingaresilientIaaSarchitectureimages/media/image07.png "ASR Recovery Plan settings")

3. After a minute or two, you should see the CloudShopRP on the Recovery plans blade. This recovery plan would bring up both servers at once during a failover. In an N-tier application, it is often best to have the data tier come up first. So, we will edit the recovery plan to accomplish this. Click the CloudShopRP recovery plan.
   
4. On the CloudShopRP blade click Customize. Within the Recovery plan blade, click + Group.

    ![An image that depicts Azure Recovery Plan Settings.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-BuildingaresilientIaaSarchitectureimages/media/image08.png "ASR Recovery Plan settings")

5. Under Group 1: Start click on the ellipse beside WebVM-1 and and WebVM-2 and choose Delete machine. Leave only SQL Server in Group-1.


6. Click on the ellipse beside Group 2: Start and choose Add protected item and Add Both Web servers. Then save the changes.

    ![An image that depicts Azure Recovery Plan Group Settings.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-BuildingaresilientIaaSarchitectureimages/media/image09.png "ASR Recovery Plan Group settings")

7. Now go back to the Recovery Services Vault BackupVault2 - Overview blade. Click on Site Recovery. Notice the two servers that make the Cloud Shop application are replicating. Take note of their status. They should be close to 100%. You will not be able to continue until they are finished replicating. 
   
   **Note**: This may take up to an hour.

### Task 3: Creating the Test Fail Over.

1. Within the Azure portal, click on Resource Groups and locate the resource group with -asr added to the end of it's name.
   
    ![An image that depicts Azure Resource Group.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-BuildingaresilientIaaSarchitectureimages/media/image10.png "ASR Resource Group")

2. Click on this resource group and notice the resources created by ASR to support workload protection and failover.

3. Navigate back to the Overview section of your Recovery Services vault via the tile on your dashboard. Under Site Recovery, click on **Replicated items** and ENSURE both Cloud Shop VMs are fully protected before continuing.
   
4. Navigate back to the Overview section of the **Recovery Services Vault**. Under Site Recovery click on **Recovery Plans**.

    ![An image that depicts Azure ASR Recovery Plan.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-BuildingaresilientIaaSarchitectureimages/media/image12.png "ASR Recovery plan")

    ![An image that depicts Azure ASR Recovery Plan.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-BuildingaresilientIaaSarchitectureimages/media/image13.png "ASR Test failover")

6. On the new Test failover blade, under Choose a recovery point, select Latest processed (low RTO) and under Azure virtual network choose **CloudShopVNET1-asr**. Click OK.

**Note**: In a 'real-world' recovery test, you should choose an isolated virtual network so as to not impact the production application. 

7. From the Recovery Services vault blade, click Jobs under MONITORING AND REPORTS. In the new blade, under General, select **Site recovery jobs**.
On the Site recovery jobs blade click on the running job (Test failover).

8. On the Test failover blade, monitor the progress of the failover. Notice each step is executing and you can track the status and execution time. Also notice that the data tier is being started first, then the app tier, as per our recovery plan.

9. Navigate back to the Overview section of the **Recovery Services Vault**. Under Site Recovery click back on Recovery plans. Notice the Recovery plan is waiting on your input.


10. Under Resource groups in the left-hand navigation bar, navigate to the resource group created for this protected workload, called CloudShopRG1-asr. Note the resources that have been created as a part of the failover action. The compute resources were not provisioned until the failover occurred.

### Task 4: Cleaning the Test Fail Over.

1. In the Azure portal, navigate back to the **Recovery Services Vault** via the dashboard tile. In the **Overview** section of the Recovery Services Vault, under the **Site Recovery tab**, click on **Recovery plans**.
   
2. Notice that the recovery plan has a pending job called **Cleanup test failover** pending. Right-click on the **CloudShopRP recovery plan** and select **Cleanup test failover**.

3. In the Test failover cleanup blade, enter notes indicating that the test was successful, and click the checkbox indicating the testing is complete. Then click OK.
   
4. Navigate back to the Overview section of the **Recovery Services Vault**. Under Site Recovery find the jobs tile and click on In-progress jobs. 
   
5. On the Site recovery jobs blade, click on the running job. Monitor the status until the environment is cleaned up (approximately 5 minutes).

6. In the Azure portal navigate to Resource Groups and click on the **CloudShopRG1-asr** resource group. Notice that the virtual machines and network interfaces have all been deleted, leaving only the resources ASR initial created to support protection and the manually-created public IP address.


## After the hands-on lab

### Task 1: Delete the resource groups created

1.  Within the Azure portal, click Resource Groups on the left navigation.

2.  Delete each of the resource groups created in this lab by clicking them followed by clicking the Delete Resource Group button. You will need to confirm the name of the resource group to delete.

You should follow all steps provided *after* attending the hands-on lab.
