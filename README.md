# Abstract

## Workshop

In this workshop, students will work with a media publishing company to design a hybrid cloud disaster recovery solution. Students will design the solution to handle large spikes in load and harden the security to include encryption of PCI data. Additionally, students will implement an archival strategy to keep databases sizes in check.

Attendees will be better able to design a hybrid disaster recovery solution between an on-premises VMWare environment and Azure. In addition,

-   Design a SQL Server scale-out solution

-   Protect database backups from local failures

-   Archive cold data from an on-premises SQL Server

-   Perform end-to-end encryption on sensitive application data
